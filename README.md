# Adresss-Book
This repository contains C++ code for a linked list implementation and an address book management system. The linked list implementation is generic and can be used to create linked lists of any data type.

The address book management system uses the linked list implementation to store and manage a collection of addresses. The system allows users to add, delete, and modify addresses, as well as search for addresses by last name.

To run the address book management system, compile and run the main.cpp file.

The addressType.h file defines the addressType class used by the system, which contains the following member variables:

firstName: a string representing the first name of the person
lastName: a string representing the last name of the person
streetAddress: a string representing the street address of the person
city: a string representing the city of the person
state: a string representing the state of the person
zip: an integer representing the zip code of the person
The linkedListType.h file defines the linkedListType class used by the system to manage the collection of addresses.

The main.cpp file contains the main function of the address book management system. It provides a menu-based interface for the user to add, delete, modify, and search for addresses.

Note: This code was written and tested on a Windows system using Visual Studio 2019. If you are using a different operating system or development environment, you may need to modify the code to make it work.
